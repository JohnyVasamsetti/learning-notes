App Mesh:

    In a micro service architecture, each service is responsible for a separate functionality.
    Services are loosely coupled i.e. each one is capable of working on its own.
    

There are a few issues that need to addressed when we have this kind of architecture.

Request Logic:

    Since each service has multiple replicas, which replica do we want to route our traffic to ?
    With rolling updates in place, how are we dealing with different version of services ?
    How do we re-route traffic when an instance gets overloaded ?
    How would you define traffic routing rules ?(how does traffic flow between applications ?) 
Logging:

    How do you isolate issues and detect point of failures in a plethora of services ?
Security:

    How do you define encryption standards ?
    How do you enforce usage of SSL certificates ?
    All these issues are addressed with App Mesh. It is a mesh that provides application level networking to make service to service communication easier.



Steps involved in App Mesh set up:

    Install the App Mesh controller
    Create the Mesh resource
    Register namespace to the mesh
    Create CRDs â†’ Virtual Node, Virtual Service, Virtual Router
    Enable App Mesh in service specific repos


What are CRDs used by App Mesh ? 

    A Virtual Node is logical pointer to the K8S deployment.
    A Virtual Service is an abstraction of a real service that is provided by a virtual node directly or indirectly by means of a virtual router.
    Virtual routers handle traffic for one or more virtual services within your mesh

TLS:

    Why do we need TLS communication ? 
    to authenticate services, establish a secure connection and send data in encrypted format over the channel.


Steps to enable TLS communication with App Mesh:

    Install cert manager - a Kubernetes native implementation for automating certificate management
    Create generic secret from TLS credentials stored in GHA
    Create the cluster issuer which will use the secret generated previous step.
    Create a certificate for each of the services in the mesh for which we want to enable TLS. The certificate creation will trigger a respective secret to be created for that service
    Mount certificate onto the deployment and virtual node
