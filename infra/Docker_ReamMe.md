																			Docker

docker run
	name
	itd
	port
	volume
	env
	
	logs
	inspect

docker-compose:
	we can also mention the Dockerfile path instead of docker image while creating the docker-compose file.
	docker-compose: version-1
		1. in default network, so you need to mention the link btw the containers because it might be possible that there are already some instance in default network.
		2. no order

	docker-compose: version-2
		1. it will create a dedicated network first then create the services inside it. so no need to mention the link property here. it will automatilly connect to that.
		2. depends_on

cgroupds:
	there is no limit for container to use cpu,memory of hosted system.
	we can restrict it using cgroups.

docker-storage:
	var/lib/docker ( the structure will based on the storage driver that we are using )
		images
		containers
		volumes
	
	docker history imagename
	docker system df
	docker system df -v

docker network: ( Same as volume commands )

	bridge
		each container will have a diff ip, we can use same port.
	null
		container not attached to any network.
	network
		in the same machine all containers will be created. the port should be different.
	
	docker run --network=none imagename
	docker network 
		create 
			--driver bridge 
			--subnet 182.18.0.1/24 
			--gateway 182.18.0.1 
		wp-mysql-network
	
	docker run --name webapp -e DB_Host=mysql-db -e DB_Password=db_pass123 -p 38080:8080 --network=wp-mysql-network --link mysql-db kodekloud/simple-webapp-mysql
	
	docker network disconnect my-net my-nginx


Docker services:
	when :
		when there need of accessing one service in another service

	Node Port  :  external service  ( exposed to outside world )
	ClusterIp  : internal service ( new ip will be created for the service to access )
	Load Balancer  : 

docker engine:
	the process running inside the container is nothing but the process running on docker host. only the process id will be different.

Basic commands: 
 	docker build -t image_name .
 	docker run -itd --name container_name image_nme
	docker exec -itd container_name bash
	docker cp source_folder container_name:destination_folder

docker ps
	to see all the  containers running

docker ps -a
	to see all the  containers including stoped containers

docker stop cname
	To stop a container

docker rm cname
 	To remove the container

docker run container 
	if not present in local repo then it will search in docker hub and it will download it.
	if you again run same command it won't download anything.

docker run -it node 
	i -> ( for taking inputs )
	t -> ( for printing the prompt )

Diff between run and cmd
	cmd won't be executed when the image was created , it will execute only when the container is started based on image.
	run will be executed while building the image.
	cmd will be executed while running the container.

EXPOSE is still optional because we need to expose port using -p while running the docker

No need to write the full id , we can write the first few characters to identify it.

Docker is READ-ONLY
Container is READ-WRITE

Docker Layers :
	Each instruction is a Layer
	When you re-build the image, only the instructions where something changed and all instructions after are re-evaluated.
	If one layer is updated then the subsequent layers will run from scratch without using Cache.

Docker start cname	=> will restart the already stoped container  without blocking the terminal.

Attached mode :
	docker run -p 8000:30 id 
	docker start -a name
	docker attach name 	

Detached mode :
	docker start name	 
	docker run -p 3000:80 -d id

Interactive mode  : for taking input
	docker run -it name
	docker start -a -i name

Logs :
	docker logs cname         =>  prints all
	docker logs -f cname     =>  print and keep on listening

Remove :
	docker rm Con_name1 Con_name2 Con_name3
	docker rmi imagename1 imagename2
	docker image prune  => delete unused images 

Automatically Remove Container : After execution
	docker run -p 8000:80 -d —rm id

Details of Image :
	docker image inspect image

Copy :
	docker cp local_source cname:path_in_container
	docker cp cname:file_in_container local_destination

Tags & Names :
	Image :
		docker build -t tag : name .
		docker tag old_name:tag  new_name:tag 
	Container  :
		docker run -—name containerName

Sharing Images and Containers
	Don’t share containers , share only Image.
	If you have image file then you can create containers based on it.
	Share Dockerfile or Share a build image

DockerHub :
	name of an image and repository in dockerHub should be same.
	change name of image using tag command.

Push & Pull :
	docker push username/reponame
	docker pull username/reponame

Volumes :
	separate storage area for container data.
	decoupling container from docker.
	deleting container will not effect volume.
	we can share it among different containers.
	
	docker volume create volume1
	docker volume inspect volume1
	docker volume prune
	docker volume rm volume1
	docker run —name ContainerName-1  -v  volume1:/var/jenkins_home -p 8080:8080 -p 5000:5000
	docker run —name ContainerName-2  -v  volume1:/var/jenkins_home -p 9090:8080 -p 4000:5000

Docker Swarm :
	group of machines which are running docker and joined into cluster.
	one manager node(docker-machine) operating the other slave nodes(docker-machine).

	Install docker-machine
	install virtualbox
	
	docker-machine create —driver virtualbox manager1
	
	docker-machine env manager1
	docker-machine ls
	docker-machine ip manager1

	docker-machine ssh ip

	docker swarm init —advertise-addr MANAGER_IP
	docker node ls

	docker swarm join-token worker		->    It will give you the command , so that you can run it on worker node to join as a worker to manager node

	docker info
	docker swarm 

Docker Compose :
	create docker-compose.yaml 

	docker-compose config

	docker-compose up -d

	docker-compose down 

	docker-compose up -d —scale database=3
